# Gripper Code - CARES Summer Research Project 

This repository contains the code used to control and test the 3 fingered gripper currently being designed and used in the CARES lab at UOA. 
While being written for this specific system, it also intends to be applicable to many dynamixel servo systems with small changes to the code.   
 
## Languages and Libraries Used: 

- Python 3.10.5
- Dynamixel SDK 
- Numpy 1.23.0 
- cares_lib
- cares_reinforcement_learning

### Setup 

The current setup uses 9 Dynamixel XL-320 servo motors (shown in image below), which are connected to a U2D2 Powerhub Board, and uses a baudrate of 57600 bps.
